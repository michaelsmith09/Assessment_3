        <h1>Ivory Homes Neighborhood</h1>
        <p>
            It is a nice neighborhood with a decent amount of restaurants nearby. It also has a huge childrens hospital that has been being built for the past 4 year and it about to be finished. Most of the food near by is down the Redwood road. There is a skate park down the road on 2100 street. We also have a good size park starting to get built now.
